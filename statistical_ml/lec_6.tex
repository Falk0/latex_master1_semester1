\section{Tree-based methods, bagging and boosting}
The idea behind tree-based methods is to break our input space into different disjoint regions and fit a model in each region. We can use classification with majority vote or regression taking the mean of the traning data in the region. 

\subsection*{finding the partition}
The key to solving this is to find a strategy to reach a good partion of these regions. Even if the regions are simple in shape, like squares it becomes computationally \textbf{infeasible} to minenimze the training error. The only way to do this is to try all this different options. 

Instead of trying all possible options we use a "greedy" approach: \textbf{recursive binary splitting} 

\begin{enumerate}
 	\item Select one input variable $x_j$ and a cut-point s. Partition the input space into two half planes

 \end{enumerate} 

 Any split at any time we partition we trying to find the best for that situation.
