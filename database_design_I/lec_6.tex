\lesson{6}{wednesday 16 nov 2022 10:15}{Normailization}

normalization is a formal way to transform the er model to relation tables and a database. With this method we avoid 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Waste storage
	\item insertion anomloies
	\item modiciation anamolies
	\item deletion anomaies
\end{itemize}

in the context of this course we will go to \textbf{Normal form 3} or \textbf{NF3} 

Functional depencency can proven if its false but its only possible that the other way around. It may hold but from one table its not possible to determine. 

partial dependency, depends partly of the key. Full dependency depends on the whole key. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{1NF} All attributes depend on the key
	\item \textbf{2NF} All attributes depend on the whole key
	\item \textbf{3NF} All attributes \textcolor{red}{depend on nothing but the key} 
\end{itemize}

We want to get rid off partial dependencys. 

\section{Basic SQL}
We will get a lot of error messages if we dont set up the relational tables correct. SQL not straight forward as Python or Java. 

remeber that foreign key shall have the same structure (like char(9)) as the "original"
